# IT5016_Assignment3_20241491
In this assignment for IT5016 where I would put together different Python 
programs I created during my learning.  
These programs show my understanding of basic Python programming and 
how good software is designed. 
What Inside?  
This project includes small programs that do things like: - Check the weather temperature - Play a guessing game - Work with lists and dictionaries - Collect and approve donation requests - Use functions with *args and **kwargs - Generate random numbers - And more! 
These scripts use things like if statements, loops, functions, file writing, and 
user input. 
How My Code is Organized 
Python code files 
donation_requests.txt File created by the donation system  
README FILE.  this file 
Software Design Principles I Used. 
1. Modularity 
I broke the code into smaller pieces using functions. For example, in the 
donation request program, I used functions like: - create_donation_request() - get_request_items() - approval_decision()  
Each one does a small job so it's easier to understand and fix if needed.  
2. Reusability 
Some functions can be reused in other programs too! For example, the 
average marks calculator can be used for any student group. 
3. Readability  
I added comments to explain what each part does, so even beginners can 
follow along. 
4. User Interaction  
All programs ask the user for input, and I added checks to make sure 
inputs are valid (like numbers only). 
5. File Handling 
The donation request program writes the details to a file 
(donation_requests.txt), showing     
how to run the programmes 
6. How to Run the Programs 
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then open your terminal or 
command prompt and run: python filename.py  
Example: 
python donation_system.py  
What I Learned - How to use if, else, for, and while loops - How to write and call functions - How to work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries - How to save data in a file - How to organize and comment my code properly - Basic software design principles in real code
